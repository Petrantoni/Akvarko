# TODO:
# - extract unmodified frames:
#   - detect frames with camera movement, use GIMP or other tool to get corners of the aquarium
#   - extract few more real times
#   - extract start end end times of individual spot tranports
# - using these:
#   - correction of crop_corners at two times when the camera was moved
#   - separate individual spot propagation into distinguished directories
